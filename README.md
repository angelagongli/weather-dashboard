# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This weather dashboard application allows a user to search for cities by name, and shows the user the current and forecasted weather conditions in those cities for 5 days in the future. The app also saves the user's search history for up to 10 cities in local storage, allowing him or her to easily click back to a previously searched city and check the weather there.

Weather information shown includes:
* temperature
* humidity
* wind speed (current only)
* UV index (current only)
* graphical representation of weather conditions

The weather dashboard can be viewed here: https://angelagongli.github.io/weather-dashboard/

## Credits
[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) is the source of all  weather data and weather condition icons displayed on the dashboard.

The UV safety levels color-coded as green for favorable, yellow for moderate, or red for severe are determined based on information from [this article about UV index](https://www.who.int/uv/intersunprogramme/activities/uv_index/en/index1.html) by the [WHO](https://www.who.int/).

The favicon image and all of the non-whether icons were taken from the collection of icons at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and used under the [Font Awesome Free License](https://fontawesome.com/license/free).

The [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) JavaScript libraries were used for DOM manipulation, AJAX, and timekeeping functions.

The design of the weather dashboard is based on guidelines by the Coding Boot Camp at UT, and has been made responsive with the use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
